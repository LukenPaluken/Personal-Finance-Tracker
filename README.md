-= Personal Finance Tracker =-

Menu Options:
- Dashboard (Overview of financial health, including current balance, recent transactions, and spending trends.)
- Transactions (View, add, and categorize income or expenses.)
- Goals (Set financial goals (e.g., saving for a vacation, paying off debt) and track progress.)
- Accounts (Manage different financial accounts (e.g., checking, savings, credit cards).)
- Close

Features:
- Tabulate for easier viewing.
- Progress bars for goals.
- Maybe tkinter integration for smoother navigation. ##



Personal notes:
- Need to fix the menu return in user.change_password(). Right now, it only goes back to user.menu() - Need it to go back to main.main_menu().
- Need to add account lock functionality to user.change_password(). Honestly just rewrite this functionality and make it a function, too much ugly repetition otherwise.
